# Web Scraper for Content and Images

This Python script scrapes a webpage for content and images inside a div with the class toc-content. The script automatically creates a unique folder for each URL, naming it based on the h1 tag of the page. The images found in the toc-content div are downloaded into this folder.

## Features

Automatic Folder Creation: A new folder is created for each URL based on the h1 tag of the page and the current timestamp. Scrapes Content and Images: The script downloads all images within the specified div (toc-content), and saves them with filenames based on the page's h1. Clean Code: The script uses best practices for clean, maintainable code.

## Requirements

Python 3.x 

## Installation and Setup

Clone the repository

To get started with this project, clone the repository using the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/MartinPotoniec/lin-image-scraper.git
cd lin-image-scraper
```

## How to Use the Script

Running the Script

To run the script, simply enter the following command into your terminal:
```
python3 script.py https://example.com/1
```
What Happens When You Run the Script?

Folder Creation: The script will automatically create a folder in the images/ directory. The folder will be named based on the h1 tag of the page you scraped, appended with a timestamp to ensure uniqueness. Image Download: All images found inside the div class=toc-content will be saved in the newly created folder. The images will be named based on the pageâ€™s h1 tag, followed by the image number.

## Example Walkthrough

Suppose you run the following command:
```
python3 script.py https://example.com/1
```
If the page has an h1 with the text "Headline ", the script will create a folder named like images/Headline_20241022-153045/. Inside this folder, the script will download all images found in the div class=toc-content and name them like Headline_image_1.jpg, Headline_image_2.jpg, etc.

### Folder Structure

After running the script, your folder structure will look something like this:
```
images/ Headline_20241022-153045/ Headline_image_1.jpg Headline_image_2.jpg
```
### Error Handling

If no div class=toc-content is found, the script will notify you that no content was found to scrape. If the webpage does not contain an h1 tag, the script will use no_h1 as the folder name.

#### Additional Notes

The script ensures that each URL results in a new folder, so images from different webpages are never overwritten. The folder names are based on the h1 tag and a timestamp to ensure unique folder names even for the same webpage.
